# Default system properties included when running spark-submit.
# This is useful for setting default environmental settings.

# Example:
# spark.master                     spark://master:7077
# spark.eventLog.enabled           true
# spark.eventLog.dir               hdfs://namenode:8021/directory
# spark.serializer                 org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer
# spark.driver.memory              5g
# spark.executor.extraJavaOptions  -XX:+PrintGCDetails -Dkey=value -Dnumbers="one two three"

# Spark default configurations

# -----------------------------
# Spark Defaults — Standalone
# (Use Spark Standalone Master/Workers)
# -----------------------------

# Use the standalone Spark master (you started master at spark://master:7077)
spark.master                        spark://master:7077

# Event log so Spark History Server / Web UI can show completed apps
spark.eventLog.enabled              true
spark.eventLog.dir                  hdfs:///spark-logs

# Spark History Server storage (same HDFS dir)
spark.history.fs.logDirectory       hdfs:///spark-logs

# Make Spark use same HDFS as Hadoop
spark.hadoop.fs.defaultFS           hdfs://master:9000

# Add Hadoop config on driver & executors (helps find core-site/hdfs-site)
spark.driver.extraClassPath         /opt/hadoop/etc/hadoop
spark.executor.extraClassPath       /opt/hadoop/etc/hadoop

# Recommended: do NOT set a global deploy mode for shells here.
# (If you add `spark.submit.deployMode` here it may break pyspark/spark-shell.)
